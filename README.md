# Student dropout rates or academic success
## Team Ignite

#### Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model that can predict student dropout rates or academic success based on a variety of factors, such as attendance, grades, and demographic data. The model should be able to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or falling behind and provide targeted interventions and support.

#### Data Collection
Data was collected from UC Irvine Machine learning Repository- https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success.

The data consists of 4424 rows and 37 features.

The secondary data was found to be free of null values,duplicates or typos, so much of data cleaning wasen't required.

The Exploratory Data Analysis was done mainly using two libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.
